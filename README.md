# Self-study Journey 2023
Dumb computer science student tries to make up to his past mistakes by learning the world of tech by himself :)

## June        [JavaScript]
5 - Although I should've worked with JavaScript already, and even though I did for a tiny bit, I think it would be a great idea to start off with some JS related projects - and perhaps working towards TypeScript.
\
\
6 - I brushed up some old JS knowledge, as well as worked my way through the Codecademy JS course and am warmed up now. Next step: a (few) personal project(s).
\
\
7 - Today I finished a basic slider programming. This made me more comfortable using JS on divs as well as gave me a more broad view of possibilities of creativity. Next step will be working on a (fake) online shop.
