Bad computer science student tries to make up by learning tech by himself :)

# June 5th        [JavaScript]
Although I should've worked with JavaScript already, and even though I did for a tiny bit, I think it would be a great idea to start off with some JS related projects - and perhaps working towards TypeScript.
I brushed up some old JS knowledge, as well as worked my way through the Codecademy JS course and am warmed up now. Next step: a (few) personal project(s).
